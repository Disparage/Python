# Created by Ethan Korte for Honors College Racing Crew use
# The Idea for this Project is to have it take data from races to allow for objective analysis of how
# kart attributes (caster, camber, etc.) affect performance and how environmental conditions (temperature
# humidity, etc.) affect performance. This project will also have a driver profile aspect which will rely
# on surveys during and after the race of impressions of how the kart was performing, this will allow
# drivers to learn what feeling from the kart is good, and what good feelings they have which aren't objectively
# good setups for the kart. This will help drivers to be able to better make on the fly judgements of how the kart
# is performing in races and make educated decisions on changes they would like on race day based on an improved
# sense of feel for how the kart performs in the real world.

# Objectives:
#
#       1. Compile and analyze data
#       2. Incorporate kart attributes and environmental data into race data
#       3. Include driver opinions with data
#       4. Analyze data through lens of kart setup
#       5. Export data in format that is understandable to the trained eye
#       6. Train club to understand, analyze, and alter data and project

# Structure:
#
#   Initial Code which adds data tags and different attributes to data then exports it
#
#   Code that analyzes data and provides understandable analysis
#
#   Code that compares different kart setups through different races with similar conditions and shows different
# strengths and weaknesses of different setups
